# Hollownest-top
A Hollow Knight rainmeter theme bundle for switching backgrounds and launching apps.

Activate all the config files and place the map and charm icons anywhere you want.  Instructions are commented into the .ini files.

If enough people are interested, I have a few ideas on what to do for v2.0 and if anyone wants to critique my code or help with multi-resolution support, then feel free to!
